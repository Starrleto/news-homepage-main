Peer Review: Kyle Yok Eyh Ma 
- The layout of desktop site looks good. Missing hover effect for the READ MORE button and article titles. Refer to /design/active-states.jpg for how they look when hovered 
- The site is responsive but not in the same layout as the challenge wanted. Besides that, the site does not do anything weird when changing screen resolutions.
- Overall: good job, missing a few little things mentioned above but no major flaws I could notice
